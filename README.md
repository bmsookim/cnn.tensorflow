# ImageRecognitionRepository for Image Recognition ChallengesThis implements training & test results of the most popular image classifying challenges, including cifar-10, cifar-100, imagenet.## RequirementsSee the [installation instructions](INSTALL.md) for a step-by-step guide.- Install [Tensorflow-0.11]()- Install [cuda-7.5]()- Install [cudnn v5]()- Install [OpenCV]()- For python library dependencies, see [./pip\_list.sh](pip_list.sh).## Directories and datasetsThere will be 7 directories for basic operation. You will need to create the missing directories ommited by .gitignore- cifar10 : A directory for python codes and implementations for CIFAR-10 dataset.- cifar100 : A directory for python codes and implementations for CIFAR-100 dataset. (will be uploaded soon)- imagenet : A directory for python codes and implementations for ISLVCR-2012 dataset. (will be uploaded soon)- input : A directory for input datasets.```bashmkdir input```- models : A directory for saved .ckpt files. This will be ignored by .gitignore.```bashmkdir models```- notebook : jupyter notebook files for step by step instruction.- output : A directory for output .csv files for each epoch step.```bashmkdir output```## How to runYou can run cifar-10 training process by```bashpython cifar10/train.py```The other training scripts for cifar-100 and ISLVCR-2012 will be uploaded soon.
